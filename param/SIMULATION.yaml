    start: "dock_2",  # start position of the robot. Can be any node from the distance_params.yaml file
    mass: 60, # define the mass. Used by the roboNode when calculating energy loss
    attribute: "1011", # define the type of tasks that the robot can do. 1011 means the robot can do task of type 0, type 1 and type 3
    capacity: 400, #define capacity of the robot. Can be understood as the weight a robot can carry. This is associated to the demand of a task. Sum of active demands should be less than capacity.
    energy: 40000, # define electrical energy in the robot, which is consumed when travelling.
    velocity: 1, # define max velocity of the robot
    BUFFER: 4, # define the max number of tasks a robot can have in the task buffer
    isAuctioner: 1, # define the ability of the robot to be able to become an acutioner.
